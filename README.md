# rock-paper-scissors
First part of the Rock paper scissors game without GUI from The Odin Project where you play against the computer  
  
What I learned:
*   Solve problem by understanding the problem first, plan and psudocode, finally break the problem into smaller pieces
*   How to select an item in an array randomly
*   Aquired better understanding of the functions, scopes and variables
*   The != comparison operator's logic when logical operators are involved
